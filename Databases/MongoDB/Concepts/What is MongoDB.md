MongoDB is a **NoSQL document database** where data is stored as **JSON-like documents** (BSON internally).
### Key points
- Stores data in **documents** (similar to JSON)
- Documents are grouped into **collections**
- Collections exist inside a **database**
- **Schema-less** → structure can change anytime
- Handles **unstructured and semi-structured** data easily
- **High performance** for reads and writes
- **Horizontally scalable** through sharding
- No traditional SQL **JOINs** (but supports joins via `$lookup`)
- Ideal for **modern applications**, real-time systems, and large-scale data
