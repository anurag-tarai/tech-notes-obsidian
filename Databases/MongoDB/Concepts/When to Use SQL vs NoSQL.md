### Use SQL when:
- Strict schema needed
- Many JOINs
- Relationship-heavy data (HR, Banking, ERP)
- Need full ACID consistency
- Fixed structure

**Examples:** Banking, finance, accounting, inventory.
### Use NoSQL when:
- Schema evolves frequently
- High read/write throughput needed
- Horizontal scaling required
- Data is unstructured (JSON, logs, events)
- Real-time apps

**Examples:** E-commerce, social apps, analytics, messaging.
