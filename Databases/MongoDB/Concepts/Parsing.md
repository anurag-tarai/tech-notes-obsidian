**Parsing** means:  
👉 _Taking raw data and converting it into a format the computer can understand and use._

In this context:

### JSON → Text

The database must **read the text**, understand the structure, convert every character into data types.

### BSON → Binary

The database directly reads a **binary structure** that is already in machine format.
