## SQL Databases
SQL databases are **relational databases** where data is stored in **tables** with rows (records) and columns (fields).
- They follow a **fixed schema**, meaning the structure of the data must be defined before inserting values.
### Key characteristics
- **Structured schema** (fixed columns)
- **Strong relationships (FK constraints)**
- **ACID transactions**
- **Joins** are common
- **Vertical scaling** (scale by increasing CPU/RAM)

Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server.

## NoSQL
NoSQL databases store data in **non-relational** formats like:
- Documents (MongoDB)
- Key-value (Redis)
- Wide-column (Cassandra)
- Graph (Neo4j)
They allow **schema-less data**, meaning the structure can change anytime.
### Key characteristics
- **Schema-less** (flexible structure)
- **Horizontal scaling** (scale by adding more servers)
- **Designed for large & unstructured data**
- **No complex joins**
- **High performance & distributed**
