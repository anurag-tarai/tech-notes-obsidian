**Think of it as your computer’s short-term memory.**

- Stores temporary data the CPU needs right now.
    
- When you close or restart your computer, RAM is cleared.
    
- Example:  
    When you open a file, it loads into RAM so it’s fast to edit.
    

🧩 **Analogy:**  
Like your desk — the bigger it is, the more things you can work on at once.
