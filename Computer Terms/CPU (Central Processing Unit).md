**Think of it as the brain of your computer.**

- It performs general-purpose tasks: running programs, doing calculations, controlling input/output.
    
- It’s great at handling **a few complex tasks at once** (serial processing).
    
- Example:  
    When you open Chrome, play music, and type — CPU coordinates all that.
    

🧩 **Analogy:**  
Like a smart worker who can solve very hard problems, but one at a time.
