**Think of it as a team of mini-brains made for visuals and heavy parallel work.**

- Originally designed for rendering graphics and games.
    
- Now used in **AI, machine learning, and data processing** because it can do **many small tasks at once**.
    
- Example:  
    Training an AI model, video rendering, or gaming visuals — GPU handles thousands of computations simultaneously.
    

🧩 **Analogy:**  
Like hundreds of workers doing simple repetitive jobs together very fast.
