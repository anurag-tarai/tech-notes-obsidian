These certifications are primarily **conceptual and foundation-level**, focused on understanding cloud architecture, services, and AI fundamentals rather than deep hands-on labs.

I didn’t have access to the Oracle free tier at that time, but I **applied the same concepts practically using AWS** in my projects, such as compute, storage, networking, security, and deployment.

For AI Foundations, the focus was on **AI/ML concepts and use cases**, and while I didn’t use Oracle AI services specifically, I understand how such services integrate with backend systems.
