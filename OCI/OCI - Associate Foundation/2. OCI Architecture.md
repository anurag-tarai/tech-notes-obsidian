### **1. Regions**
- A **Region** is a **geographic location** where OCI data centers are located.
- Example: `India (Hyderabad)`, `US East (Ashburn)`, `UK (London)`.
- Each region has **multiple availability domains (ADs)** or **fault domains (FDs)** for high availability.
- When you choose a region, your resources (VMs, databases, storage, etc.) will physically exist there.

---
### **2. Availability Domain (AD)**
- An **Availability Domain** is like a **data center** within a region.
- A region can have **1 or more ADs** (depends on the region).
- ADs in the same region are **isolated from each other** (separate power, cooling, network), so if one goes down, the others remain up.
- Example:
    - `US East (Ashburn)` region has **3 ADs** → `AD-1`, `AD-2`, `AD-3`. 
    - `India (Hyderabad)` region has **1 AD**.  

---
### **3. Fault Domain (FD)**
- A **Fault Domain** is like a **rack-level isolation** within an AD.
- Each AD has **3 Fault Domains (FD-1, FD-2, FD-3)**.
- If one FD has hardware issues (like a rack failure), the other FDs keep working.
- You spread your resources across fault domains for **high availability within an AD**.

---

✅ **In short:**
- **Region** = City/Geographic area.
- **Availability Domain (AD)** = Data center in that region.
- **Fault Domain (FD)** = Rack group inside that data center.
