✔ Why `“have had”` is correct
- The first **have** = **auxiliary verb** (used to form the present perfect tense)
- The second **had** = **main verb** (meaning “to experience” or “to possess”)
### ✔ Example sentences
- **We have had** a great time.
- **I have had** this phone for two years.
- **They have had** many challenges.
```

### ✔ **shrink**
**Base verb** (present)  
Meaning: to become smaller  
Example: _Clothes shrink in hot water._

### ✔ **shrank**
**Past tense**  
Example: _The shirt shrank yesterday._

### ✔ **shrunk**
**Past participle** (used with **have/has/had**)  
Example:
- _The shirt has shrunk._
- _They have shrunk the image._

```ad-note
# ✅ When to Use **Past Tense**

Use the **past tense** when the action **happened at a specific time in the past** and is **finished**.
### Structure:

**verb (past form)**  
(no “have/has/had”)

### Examples:

- _I **ate** breakfast at 8 AM._
    
- _She **went** home yesterday._
    
- _The shirt **shrank** last week._

# ✅ When to Use **Past Participle**

Use the **past participle** only with **have / has / had** (perfect tenses) or in passive voice.

### 1) **With have/has** → Present Perfect

Action happened before now, but **time not specified** or still relevant.

- _I **have eaten** already._
    
- _The shirt **has shrunk**._
    

### 2) **With had** → Past Perfect

Action happened **before another past action**.
- **I had eaten** before he arrived.
    
    - (First action = eaten → past perfect)
        
    - (Second action = arrived → simple past)
        
- **The shirt had shrunk** before I noticed.
    
    - (First action = shrunk → past perfect)
        
    - (Second action = noticed → simple past)
      
### 🔑 Formula:
**Earlier past action → Past Perfect (had + V3)**  
**Later past action → Simple Past (V2)**

### 3) **Passive voice**

- _The work was **done**._
    
- _The rule was **broken**._
