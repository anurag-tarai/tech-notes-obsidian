> **Spring Boot is an extension of Spring that removes boilerplate code and makes application development faster using auto-configuration and embedded servers.**
### Spring Framework

- Core Java framework
- **More configuration required**
- Uses **XML / Java config**
- Needs **external server** (Tomcat)
- Slower setup for projects
- Developer controls everything

👉 Used when you want **full control**, but setup is complex.

### Spring Boot
- Built **on top of Spring**
- **Auto-configuration**
- **Embedded server** (no external Tomcat)
- Minimal configuration
- Faster development
- Opinionated defaults

👉 Used for **quick, production-ready applications** and **microservices**.

`Opinionated` means Spring Boot provides default configurations and best practices automatically to reduce manual setup.
