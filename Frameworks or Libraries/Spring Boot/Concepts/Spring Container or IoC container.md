**Spring Container** is the core component of the Spring Framework that **creates, manages, and controls the lifecycle of Spring beans** using the principle of **Inversion of Control (IoC)** and **Dependency Injection (DI)**.

## Types of Spring Container

Spring provides **two main IoC containers**:

1. **[BeanFactory](BeanFactory.md)** 
2. **[ApplicationContext](ApplicationContext.md)**
