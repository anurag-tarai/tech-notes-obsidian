Spring Boot is an **extension of Spring Framework** that makes it **easy and fast to build production-ready applications** with minimal configuration.

It provides:
- **Auto-configuration**
- **Embedded servers** (Tomcat, Jetty)
- **Starter dependencies**
- **Production-ready features** like Actuator

👉 With Spring Boot, you can run a Spring app using:
```java
