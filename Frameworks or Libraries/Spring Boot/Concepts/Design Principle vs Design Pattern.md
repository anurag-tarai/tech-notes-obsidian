**Design Principles** are high-level guidelines or best practices used to design clean, maintainable, and scalable software. They focus on _how code should be structured_ and _how responsibilities should be divided_. Examples include **SOLID**, **DRY**, **KISS**, and **Separation of Concerns**.

**Design Patterns** are reusable, proven solutions to common software design problems. They provide _standard ways to implement code_ for specific scenarios. Examples include **Singleton**, **Factory**, **Observer**, and **Strategy**.

👉 **Key Difference:**  
Design principles guide **thinking and design decisions**, while design patterns provide **concrete solutions** that follow those principles.

👉 **Relationship:**  
Design patterns are built using design principles.
