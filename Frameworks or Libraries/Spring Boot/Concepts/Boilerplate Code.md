> Boilerplate code is repetitive, standard setup code required by a framework or language, which does not contain business logic.

Example :
```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // your logic here
    }
}
```
That structure is **boilerplate**.  
You write it every time, even though it doesn’t solve your problem.
