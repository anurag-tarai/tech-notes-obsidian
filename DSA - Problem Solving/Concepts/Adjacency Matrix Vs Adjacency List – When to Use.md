## Use matrix when:
1. **Graph is small** – few nodes
2. **Graph is dense** – most nodes are connected
3. **Need to check edge existence fast** – O(1) lookup
4. **Graph size is fixed** – not growing dynamically

**Example:**
- Classroom seating chart
- Small board game map
- Floyd-Warshall algorithm

## Adjacency List – When to Use
Use **list** when:
1. **Graph is large** – many nodes
2. **Graph is sparse** – few connections
3. **Memory efficiency is important**
4. **Edges change dynamically** – adding/removing edges
5. **Traversals like BFS/DFS**

**Example:**
- Social network friends graph (Facebook, Instagram)
- Road maps
- Real-world networks
