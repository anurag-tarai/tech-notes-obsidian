### Undirected Graph
**Degree** = number of edges connected to a vertex
#### Property
Total Degree Of Graph = `2 * E` (E - total edge of graph)

---

### Directed Graph
In directed graphs, degree is split into two types:
#### In-degree
- Number of edges **coming into** a vertex
#### Out-degree
- Number of edges **going out** of a vertex
#### Example
`A → B → C`

|Vertex|In-degree|Out-degree|
|---|---|---|
|A|0|1|
|B|1|1|
|C|1|0|

---

## 🔹 Special Cases

### 🔁 Self-loop

- A self-loop adds:
    
    - **2** to degree in undirected graph
        
    - **1 in-degree & 1 out-degree** in directed graph

## 🔹 Important Properties (DSA)

### Handshaking Lemma

- Sum of degrees of all vertices = **2 × number of edges** (undirected)

## 🧠 Interview One-liner

> Degree of a vertex is the number of edges incident on it.

---

## ⚠ Common Confusions

❌ Degree = number of neighbors  
✔ Degree = number of **edges**

(Neighbors = degree only when no multi-edges)

Just say 👍In directed graphs, degree is split into two types:

### 1️⃣ **In-degree**

- Number of edges **coming into** a vertex
    

### 2️⃣ **Out-degree**

- Number of edges **going out** of a vertex
    

#### Example

`A → B → C`

|Vertex|In-degree|Out-degree|
|---|---|---|
|A|0|1|
|B|1|1|
|C|1|0|
