### Undirected Graph
**Degree** = number of edges connected to a vertex
#### Property
Total Degree Of Graph = `2 * E` (E - total edge of graph)

---

### Directed Graph
In directed graphs, degree is split into two types:
#### In-degree
- Number of edges **coming into** a vertex
#### Out-degree
- Number of edges **going out** of a vertex
#### Example
`A → B → C`

|Vertex|In-degree|Out-degree|
|---|---|---|
|A|0|1|
|B|1|1|
|C|1|0|
