You are given an array of size **n** containing numbers from **1 to n**, but **one number is missing** and **one number appears twice**.

Write a function to **find the duplicate number and the missing number**.

### **Constraints**

- Exactly **one number** is duplicated.
    
- Exactly **one number** is missing.
    
- All numbers are in the range **1 to n**.
    
- Try to solve using:
    
    - **O(n)** time
        
    - **O(1)** extra space (modifying the array if needed)
        

### **Example**

Input:  
`[1, 2, 2, 4]`

Output:  
Duplicate → `2`  
Missing → `3`
