> **Dynamic Programming = Optimized Recursion**

DP is used when:
1. **Same subproblems repeat**
2. **Big problem can be broken into smaller ones**

Instead of recalculating again and again, we **store the result** and reuse it.

## DP has 3 main approaches

### 1. **Recursion (Brute Force)**

Slow ❌

### 2. **Memoization (Top-Down DP)**

Recursion + cache ✅

### 3. **Tabulation (Bottom-Up DP)**

Iterative DP table ✅✅ (most used in interviews)
