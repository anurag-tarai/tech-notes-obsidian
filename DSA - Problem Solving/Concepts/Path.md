A **path** is a **sequence of vertices** such that **each consecutive pair is connected by an edge**.

Example :
```java
A — B — C — D
```
`A → B → C → D` is a **path** from `A` to `D`

#### Path Length
- **Path length** = number of **edges**.
- Not number of nodes.
e.g. - `A → B → C` : Nodes = 3, Path length = 2
