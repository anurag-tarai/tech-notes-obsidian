## 🌳 Binary Tree

Each node can have **at most two children**, commonly referred to as the **left** and **right** child.

- **Full Binary Tree** – Every node has either **0 or 2 children**.
    
- **Complete Binary Tree** – All levels are completely filled except possibly the last level, which is filled **from left to right**.
    
- **Balanced Binary Tree** – The height difference between the left and right subtrees of every node is **minimal**.

## 🌳 Ternary Tree

Each node can have **at most three children**, usually labeled as **left**, **middle**, and **right**.

## 🌳 N-ary Tree (Generic Tree)

Each node can have **any number of children**.

- Each node typically contains:
    
    - **Data**
        
    - A **list of references** to its child nodes (duplicates are not allowed)
        
- Unlike linked lists, a node can store references to **multiple child nodes**.
