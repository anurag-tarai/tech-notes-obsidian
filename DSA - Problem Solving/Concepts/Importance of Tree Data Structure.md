- File systems on computers are structured as trees, with folders containing subfolders and files.
- The DOM (Document Object Model) of an HTML page is a tree:The `<html>` tag is the root.`<head>` and <body> are its children.These tags can have their own child nodes, forming a hierarchical structure.
- Trees help in efficient data organization and retrieval for hierarchical relationships.
