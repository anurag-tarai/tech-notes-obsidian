A **Binary Tree** is a tree where **each node has at most 2 children**:
- **Left child** 
- **Right child** 

```ad-note
 There is **NO ordering rule** (that’s only for BST).
```

Example :
```java
        1
       / \
      2   3
     / \
    4   5
```
This is a **Binary Tree**, not necessarily a BST.
