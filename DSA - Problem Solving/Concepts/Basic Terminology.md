### Basic Terminologies In Tree Data Structure:

- ****Parent Node:**** A node that is an immediate predecessor of another node. Example: 35 is the parent of 3 and 6.
- ****Child Node:**** A node that is an immediate successor of another node. Example: 3 and 6 are children of 35.
- ****Root Node:**** The topmost node in a tree, which does not have a parent. Example: 15 is the root node.
- ****Leaf Node (External Node):**** Nodes that do not have any children. Example: 1, 10, 12, 5, 7, 7 are leaf nodes.
- ****Ancestor:**** Any node on the path from the root to a given node (excluding the node itself). Example: 15 and 35 are ancestors of 10.
- ****Descendant:**** A node x is a descendant of another node y if y is an ancestor of x. Example: 1, 10, and 6 are descendants of 35.
- ****Sibling:**** Nodes that share the same parent. Example: 1 and 10 are siblings, and 5 and 7 are siblings.
- ****Level of a Node:**** The number of edges in the path from the root to that node.The root node is at level 0.
- ****Internal Node:**** A node with at least one child.
- ****Neighbor of a Node:**** The parent or children of a node.
- ****Subtree:****  A node and all its descendants form a subtree.
