### 1️⃣ **Undirected Graph**

- Edges have no direction
    
- Used in: connected components, cycle detection, MST
    

---

### 2️⃣ **Directed Graph**

- Edges have direction
    
- Used in: topological sort, SCC, course schedule
    

---

### 3️⃣ **Weighted Graph**

- Edges have weights
    
- Used in: Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall
    

---

### 4️⃣ **Unweighted Graph**

- All edges equal
    
- Used in: BFS shortest path
    

---

## 🔹 Structure-based (Very Important)

### 5️⃣ **Tree**

- Connected + no cycles
    
- Special case of graph
    
- Used everywhere (DFS, BFS, DP on trees)
    

---

### 6️⃣ **DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)**

- Directed + no cycles
    
- Used in:
    
    - Topological sort
        
    - DP on graphs
        
    - Scheduling problems
