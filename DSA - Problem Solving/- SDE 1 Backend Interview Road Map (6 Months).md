## I. Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)

**Goal:** Master Medium problems and approach Hard problems efficiently. Your 6-month DSA plan covers this perfectly.

|**Month**|**Focus Area**|**Key Deliverable**|
|---|---|---|
|**1–2**|**Foundations** (Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists, Trees)|Solidify 50+ Medium problems. Focus on **Two Pointers**, **Sliding Window**, and **Tree Traversal**.|
|**3–4**|**Advanced Structures** (Heaps, Graphs, DP)|Conquer **Dynamic Programming** and **Graph** problems. These are high-leverage topics for SDE 1.|
|**5–6**|**Speed & Review**|Timed practice (45 minutes per problem) and focused review of the top **100 curated interview questions**.|

## II. Core Backend Fundamentals (The "Why" and "How")

This section covers the theoretical and practical knowledge specific to your Java/Spring expertise.

### A. Java & Spring Boot Deep Dive (Months 1–3)

- **Java OOP, Collections, & Generics:** Go beyond simple definitions. Understand how `HashMap` works internally, the difference between `ArrayList` and `LinkedList`, and the use of **Generics**.
    
- **Java Concurrency & Multithreading:** This is critical for backend. Understand `Thread` lifecycle, `synchronized` keyword, `volatile`, `Deadlock`. Study the `java.util.concurrent` package (e.g., `ExecutorService`, `ConcurrentHashMap`).
    
- **Spring Boot/Framework:** Discuss **IoC (Inversion of Control)**, **Dependency Injection**, **Spring MVC Flow**, and **AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming)**. Use your project experience to explain service layer and API development.
    

### B. Databases & Persistence (Months 2–4)

- **SQL (MySQL/PostgreSQL):** Master **JOINs** (especially outer joins), **Indexing** (how they work and when to use them), and **Query Optimization**. You have hands-on experience with MySQL and PostgreSQL/AWS RDS.
    
- **NoSQL (MongoDB/Redis):** Clearly articulate the **trade-offs** between relational (SQL) and non-relational (NoSQL). Your use of **MongoDB Atlas** for journaling and **Redis** for caching is a huge plus; prepare to discuss _why_ you chose them for those specific use cases (e.g., Redis for speeding up frequently accessed entries).
    
- **ORMs:** Understand the mechanics of **Hibernate/JPA** and why you used it (or didn't) in your Spring Boot projects.
    

### C. Networking & APIs (Months 1–2)

- **HTTP/HTTPS:** Understand the difference between HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), **Status Codes**, and the overall request-response cycle.
    
- **RESTful APIs:** You built 30+ APIs. Be ready to discuss API design principles, idempotency, and versioning.
    
- **Security:** Explain your use of **JWT-based authentication** and **Spring Security** from your projects.

## III. Low-Level Design (LLD) and System Design

The SDE 1 design round often focuses on **LLD** (Object-Oriented Design) and basic **System Design** concepts.

### A. Low-Level Design (LLD) (Months 3–5)

- **OOP Principles:** Practice designing classes for real-world scenarios (e.g., Parking Lot, Vending Machine). Master **SOLID** principles (especially Single Responsibility and Open/Closed).
    
- **Design Patterns:** Focus on common patterns like **Singleton** (thread-safe implementation), **Factory**, and **Builder**.
    

### B. System Design Fundamentals (Months 4–6)

- **The Big Picture:** For SDE 1, you won't be asked to design Twitter, but rather to show you understand the components.
    
    - **Scaling:** Vertical vs. Horizontal Scaling, Load Balancing.
        
    - **Caching:** When and where to cache (Client, CDN, Server, DB). You used Redis, so be ready to discuss cache eviction policies and consistency.
        
    - **Databases:** Sharding, Replication, and the **CAP Theorem** (Consistency, Availability, Partition Tolerance).
        
    - **Messaging:** The role of Message Queues (e.g., Kafka/RabbitMQ) in asynchronous communication.
        
- **Practice Simple Designs:** Prepare to design systems that are relevant to your projects, such as:
    
    - A Rate Limiter
        
    - A simple Caching layer
        
    - The backend for your **E-Canteen Booking Service**

## 🚀 Execution Summary

1. **Morning (2 hours):** Dedicate this to your **DSA plan** (Phase 1, 2, or 3). Focus on Medium and Hard problems.
    
2. **Evening (1 hour):** Rotate through the **Core Backend Fundamentals** and **Design** topics. Use your resume's projects (`Farmer Connect`, `Journal Application`, `E-Canteen`) as case studies to explain your technical choices.
    
3. **The "STAR" Method:** For behavioral/experience questions, use the **STAR** (Situation, Task, Action, Result) method to narrate your project achievements, highlighting your ownership and impact (e.g., "reduced food waste through accurate demand forecasting").
