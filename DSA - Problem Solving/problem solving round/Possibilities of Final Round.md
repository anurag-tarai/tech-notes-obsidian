## What “Problem Solving Round” Usually Means (99% cases)

For a role like **Java Backend / Intern / Associate**, it is **NOT**:

- ❌ Hard LeetCode
    
- ❌ Dynamic Programming
    
- ❌ Graphs, Tries, Bitmasking
    

It is **ONE of these 6 buckets** 👇

---

## 1️⃣ Pure Logic + Arrays / Strings (MOST COMMON)

**What happens**

- 1–2 small problems
    
- Write code or explain logic
    
- They care about **clarity**, not speed
    

**Examples**

- Reverse array / string
    
- Find second largest number
    
- Count frequency of characters
    
- Remove duplicates
    
- Check palindrome / anagram
    

**How to prepare**

- Basic loops
    
- Conditions
    
- Edge cases
    

👉 This is **safe zone for you**.

---

## 2️⃣ Collections + Objects (VERY LIKELY FOR YOU)

**What happens**

- Given a List of objects
    
- Asked to filter / group / aggregate
    

**Examples**

- Group employees by department
    
- Find highest salary per department
    
- Filter users based on skills
    
- Count occurrences using HashMap
    

**What they test**

- Can you choose **List vs Set vs Map**
    
- Can you think in **one pass**
    
- Can you explain approach
    

👉 This matches your resume perfectly.

## 3️⃣ Simple DSA (LIGHT)

**What happens**

- One standard question
    
- No trick, no optimization obsession
    

**Examples**

- Two sum
    
- Missing number
    
- Move zeros
    
- Fibonacci
    
- Prime check
    

**What they want**

- Correct logic
    
- Reasonable complexity (O(n))
    

👉 Even if you’re “average”, this is manageable.

---

## 4️⃣ Pseudo-Real Backend Problem (VERY RELEVANT)

**What happens**

- Problem described like a real system
    
- But solved using in-memory collections
    

**Examples**

- Match users to jobs based on skills
    
- Process orders and generate summary
    
- Find top users by activity
    

**What they test**

- Business thinking
    
- Clean approach
    
- Not frameworks
    

👉 This is where **you slightly panicked earlier**, but it’s learnable.

---

## 5️⃣ Verbal Problem Solving (NO CODING)

**What happens**

- They describe a problem
    
- You explain how you’d solve it
    

**Examples**

- “How would you group data efficiently?”
    
- “Which data structure would you use and why?”
    
- “How would you handle duplicates?”
    

**What they test**

- Thought process
    
- Communication
    
- Decision making
    

👉 English perfection NOT required. Clarity matters.

---

## 6️⃣ Hybrid (Code + Explain)

**What happens**

- Write partial code
    
- Explain remaining logic
    

**Examples**

- “Implement core logic, skip boilerplate”
    
- “Explain edge cases”
    

👉 Very common when time is short.

---

## 🔥 What Will NOT Happen (Be Assured)

- ❌ They won’t expect Streams mastery
    
- ❌ They won’t compare you to cheaters
    
- ❌ They won’t reject for imperfect English
    
- ❌ They won’t expect enterprise-level design
    

---

## 🎯 What YOU Should Prepare (Laser Focus)

If you prepare **only these**, you’re covered:

### Mandatory

- Arrays (10–15 problems)
    
- Strings (10–15 problems)
    
- HashMap frequency pattern
    
- Grouping objects using Map
    
- Set usage for uniqueness
    

### Optional (Nice to have)

- Sorting custom objects
    
- Explaining time complexity
    

---

## 🧠 Reality Check (Please Read)

You:

- Cleared Coderbyte
    
- Cleared discussion round
    
- Reached machine coding
    
- Have strong resume alignment
    

That alone means **you are already above average**.

Your problem is **anxiety**, not ability.
