> **Backward compatibility** means that after a backend API change, **existing clients continue to work without any modification**.

That’s it.  
No tools, no process, no jargon.

If you want a **one-liner with responsibility included**:

> Backward compatibility is ensured by the backend by making API changes that do not break existing clients.

And an **example in one line**:

> Adding a new field is backward-compatible; renaming or removing an existing field is not.
