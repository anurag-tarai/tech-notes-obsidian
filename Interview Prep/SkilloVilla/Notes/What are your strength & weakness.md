## ✅ STRENGTHS – with real-life examples

### 1. Positive attitude in any situation

**Answer example:**

### 2. Dedicated to my work

**Answer example:**

> “In my internship at ESSPL, I was responsible for developing and fixing APIs. When I faced issues, I spent extra time after office hours to debug and complete the task on time because I wanted to deliver quality work.”

_(This sounds responsible, not overworking.)_
