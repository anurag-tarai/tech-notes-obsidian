## Intro should be in little story telling  mode

I’m a **2025 MCA graduate** with a strong interest in backend development. My journey in coding started during my internship at **ESSPL, Bhubaneswar**, where I got hands-on experience building **Java and Spring Boot applications**.

After my internship, I focused on **strengthening my backend skills and exploring the cloud**. I earned **two OCI foundational certifications**, deployed my projects on **AWS and other cloud platforms**, and over the past few months, I’ve been solving **LeetCode problems** to sharpen my problem-solving abilities.

I enjoy working with technologies like **Java, Spring Boot, MySQL, MongoDB, AWS (EC2, S3, RDS), Git & GitHub, Docker**, and I also have a foundational understanding of **AI concepts**. I’m excited to bring my skills and learning mindset to real-world backend projects
