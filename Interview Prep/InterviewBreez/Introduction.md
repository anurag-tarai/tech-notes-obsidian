**Good evening. My name is Anurag Tarai.**  
I’m a **2025 MCA graduate** with experience in developing backend applications using **Java and Spring Boot**, gained through an internship and academic projects.  
I have worked with **SQL and NoSQL databases** and used **AWS services such as EC2, RDS, and S3** for deploying backend applications.  
I’m interested in this internship because it allows me to **work on real systems**, learn how cloud infrastructure is built, get to interact with experience developer and grow as a backend developer.  
**Thank you.**


After my internship ended in July, I focused on strengthening my backend fundamentals, cloud deployment, and DSA. I worked on deploying production-ready projects and alongside I am looking for a job where I can apply these skill to work on real system in production, and grow as a software engineer.
## Intro should be in little story telling  mode
