My name is Anurag Tarai. I am a 2025 MCA graduate with a strong interest in backend development.

During my academic years, I primarily focused on learning backend development using Java and Spring Boot. Using these technologies, I built both academic and personal projects, which helped me strengthen my understanding of REST APIs, databases, and backend architecture.

I then got an on-site internship opportunity at Enterprise System Solutions Pvt. Ltd. in Bhubaneswar as a Java Developer Intern. During the initial phase, I was mentored by senior developers and worked on proof-of-concepts. Later, I collaborated with a team to develop an e-canteen module as part of an internal company project, where I implemented APIs to handle food booking across multiple time slots. This experience gave me exposure to how real-world software is built and how teams collaborate in an industry environment.

After completing the internship, I focused on strengthening my backend fundamentals, enhancing my projects with additional features, and learning cloud technologies. I deployed my applications to the cloud and also earned two Oracle Cloud Infrastructure certifications.

Now, I am looking for a team and an environment where I can apply what I’ve learned, continue improving as a backend engineer, and contribute to building robust and scalable backend systems.

Thank you.
