**SEO (Search Engine Optimization)** relies on search engines understanding your page content. Semantic HTML **gives meaning** to your content, so search engines can index it better.
### How it helps:

1. **Clear Structure:** Search engines know which content is main (`<main>`), navigation (`<nav>`), or secondary (`<aside>`).
    
2. **Content Prioritization:** `<article>`, `<section>`, `<header>` tags help search engines identify important content.
    
3. **Rich Snippets:** `<figure>` with `<figcaption>` or `<time>` can be used for enhanced search results.
    
4. **Better Keywords Context:** Semantic tags make it easier for search engines to understand what your page is about.

Example :
```html
<main>
  <article>
    <h1>Top 10 Travel Destinations</h1>
    <p>Content about destinations...</p>
  </article>
</main>
```

> Search engines know the `<h1>` inside `<article>` is the main topic of the page.

Semantic tags help **Google & other engines understand your content better**, which improves ranking.
