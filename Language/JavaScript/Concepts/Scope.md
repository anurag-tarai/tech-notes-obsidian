 **scope** defines the **region of a program** where a variable or function is **valid and accessible**.
- It determines the visibility and lifetime of a variable.

### Types of Scope
- **Global Scope:** Variables declared in the global scope are **accessible from anywhere** in the entire program.
    
- **Local or Function Scope:** Variables declared inside a function are only **accessible within that function**. They are "local" to it.
    
- **Block Scope:** In modern programming languages, variables declared within a block of code (defined by curly braces, e.g., in `if` statements or `for` loops) are only **accessible within that specific block**.
### Why is Scope Important?

- Avoids **name conflicts**
    
- Improves **code organization**, readability, and safety
    
- Controls **variable lifetime** and prevents accidental access
