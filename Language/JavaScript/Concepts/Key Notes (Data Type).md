- JS is **dynamically typed** → type decided at runtime.  
- `typeof null === "object"; ` // historical bug
- == does [type coercion](What%20is%20Type%20Coercion?.md), === does not
- `null === null`  // true
- `null == undefined` // true (NOT recommended)
- `typeof function() {}` → "function" (special case).
- `Symbol` is always **unique**, cannot be recreated.
- `typeof NaN === "number"` → also important quirk.
- `NaN === NaN` → false
