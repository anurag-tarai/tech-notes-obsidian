## HTML (HyperText Markup Language)
HTML is the **static markup source** sent from the server to the browser.  
It defines the **structure and content** of a webpage using tags.  
HTML exists as a **text document**, not as objects.
## DOM
The **DOM (Document Object Model)** is a **browser-provided, in-memory representation** of the structure of a webpage/html.

When the browser loads HTML:
1. It **parses** the HTML
2. Builds a **tree data structure**
3. Exposes it via a **programming interface (Web APIs)** so JavaScript can:
    - Read content
    - Modify content
    - Add or remove elements
    - Listen to user interactions
    

> The DOM is **not JavaScript**. 
> 
> It is a **Web API** the browser gives you.  
> JavaScript is simply the language used to interact with it.
