> **File Handling** is the process of **creating, reading, writing, updating, and deleting files** stored on a **permanent storage** (hard disk, SSD, etc.).

In Java, file handling allows a program to:
- Store data permanently
- Read existing data
- Modify or delete data
### Example (Real-life)
- Saving user data to a file
- Reading configuration from `config.properties`
- Writing logs to `app.log`
### In Java
Java provides APIs mainly through:
- `java.io` (older, stream-based)
- `java.nio` (newer, faster, buffer-based)
