- Allows **duplicates**
- Maintains **insertion order**
- Index-based access

### Implementations:

| Class      | Features                      |
| ---------- | ----------------------------- |
| ArrayList  | Fast read, slow insert/delete |
| LinkedList | Fast insert/delete            |
| Vector     | Thread-safe (legacy)          |
| Stack      | LIFO (legacy)                 |
> `Vector` and `Stack` are legacy classes, meaning they are outdated and maintained only for [Backward compatibility](Backward%20compatibility.md) . Modern alternatives like `ArrayList` and `Deque` are preferred
