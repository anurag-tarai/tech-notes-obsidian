# Engineering Knowledge Base

A living archive of my technical growth.

This repository is a direct sync of my Obsidian vault. It serves as a **personal knowledge base** where I capture the concepts I study, the problems I solve, and the technologies I explore daily.

> "Writing is the mechanism through which I crystallize my understanding."

## Core Objectives

This repository is built to:

- **Systematize Knowledge**  
    Document complex concepts (Backend Architecture, Cloud, JVM internals) to ensure long-term retention rather than temporary memorization.
    
- **Track Problem-Solving Patterns**  
    Maintain a log of algorithmic strategies and data structure insights, moving beyond just "getting the answer" to understanding the approach.
    
- **Bridge Theory and Practice**  
    Connect core Computer Science fundamentals to real-world software development scenarios.

## Context and Status

- **Continuous Integration**: Notes are updated frequently as I learn.
    
- **Raw Output**: Some files are working drafts or "scratchpads" for active thought processes.
    
- **Living Document**: Accuracy and depth evolve alongside my experience level.
