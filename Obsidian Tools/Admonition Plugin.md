## **Step 4: Add Emojis or Custom Text**

You can combine emojis or extra formatting for clarity:

```

```ad-tip
Tip: Review Loops and Conditionals regularly for Java basics.

```

```ad-note
collapse: true
This is a collapsible note.
You can fold it when done reading.
yaml

- Users can **click to expand or collapse** in preview mode.  
- Great for long notes or “ongoing topics.”
```
