# 🌾 Farmer Connect — Clear, Non-Technical Document

**Farmer Connect** is a location-based platform that helps people discover nearby farmers and the products they grow.  
It is **not** an e-commerce marketplace — it does **not** handle payments or delivery. Instead, it’s a **local discovery tool**: a simple digital map that shows what farmers around you are producing so buyers can visit, call, or navigate to the farm directly.

**Primary goals**

- Make it easy for local buyers to find nearby farmers and fresh produce.
    
- Increase farmers’ visibility within their local community.
    
- Encourage direct, transparent connections between farmers and buyers.

## 🧭 How it works (for non-technical users)

### For Buyers / General Users

If you want to know which farmers or which vegetables are available near you:

- Open the app and use an **interactive map** (OpenStreetMap + Leaflet).
    
- See all products and listings within **20 km** of a selected location. You can search by:
    
    - Using the map (move or click),
        
    - Your current GPS location, or
        
    - Typing an address in the map search.
        
- Filter results by **product name, category, keywords, or address**.
    
- Tap any product to view full details (images, description, available quantity).
    
- Use the **Google Maps redirect** to get navigation directions to the farmer’s location.
    
- View farmer contact details and contact the farmer directly.
    
- Read and leave comments on product listings (comment section available).
    
- Save items to a local **wishlist** for future reference.
    

This keeps things simple: discover -> check details -> go visit or contact. No online ordering, no logistics.

## 🌱 For Farmers

Farmers get an easy-to-use dashboard where they can:

- Add products with photos, available quantity, and description.
    
- Pin their exact location on the map using current GPS, by searching an address, or by manual map selection.
    
- Update availability, change images, edit details, or remove products anytime.
    
- Reply to buyer comments on their product listings.
    

This gives farmers a straightforward way to showcase what they grow and make it discoverable to people nearby.

## 🎯 Vision & Purpose

Farmer Connect is community-first, created to:

- Increase awareness of local farmers and their produce.
    
- Encourage people to buy directly from growers.
    
- Promote trust and transparency in local food systems.
    
- Reduce reliance on middlemen and support small/local farming communities.
    

It’s a **digital bridge** between farmers and buyers — designed to complement, not replace, traditional markets or farm visits.

## 🔮 Future possibilities (planned enhancements)

Planned, community-focused features include:

- Farmer profile pages (full farm information).
    
- Rating and feedback systems.
    
- Listings of upcoming or in-season crops.
    
- “Grown by this farmer” collections and better farmer-curated pages.
    
- More community tools and local insights.
    

The long-term aim is to build a **farmer identity platform** that highlights farmers and their practices, not just a list of products.
