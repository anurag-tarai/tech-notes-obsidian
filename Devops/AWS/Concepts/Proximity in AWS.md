###### Definition:
Proximity refers to **how close your cloud resources (servers, databases, etc.) are to your end users** in terms of **network distance** (latency).

###### 🧩 Why Proximity Matters

1. **Lower Latency** – The closer your AWS Region or Availability Zone is to users, the **faster the response time**.
    
2. **Better Performance** – Applications like video streaming, gaming, or real-time analytics need **minimal delay**.
    
3. **Compliance & Data Residency** – Some regulations require that data **remain in a specific country or region**.
